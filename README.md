# Project Description
A 2D Particle Engine which uses Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINN) to resolve collisions. I trained a model using DeepXDE and PyTorch to update the position and velocity of particles after collisions. The code uses CPython to call the PINN each time a collision is detected. Future updates to this project will explore how to resolve more complex forces and simulations like computational fluid dynamics (CFD).
